<h1>Privacy Policy for G Task Express</h1>

<p>
    Effective Date: May 21, 2024
</p>

<p>
    G Task Express ("we", "our", or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we
    collect, use, and protect your information when you use our Chrome extension ("Extension") to manage your Google
    Tasks.
</p>

<h3>Information We Collect</h3>

<p>
    Google Tasks Data: When you use our Extension, you will be asked to grant permission to access your Google Tasks
    data. This includes reading your task lists and creating new tasks. We only access this data to provide the
    functionality of the Extension.
</p>

<p>
    OAuth Tokens: To interact with the Google Tasks API, our Extension uses OAuth 2.0 tokens provided by Google. These
    tokens are stored locally on your browser and are used to authenticate API requests.
</p>

<h3>How We Use Information</h3>

<p>
    Google Tasks Management: We use the data we collect solely to provide the functionality of the Extension. This
    includes reading your task lists, displaying them to you, and allowing you to create new tasks.
</p>

<p>
    No Backend Storage: We do not store any of your Google Tasks data on our servers. All data processing occurs locally
    on your device.
</p>

<h3>Information Sharing</h3>

<p>
    Third-Party Services: We do not share your Google Tasks data with third parties. The data accessed by the Extension
    is used only within the context of providing the functionality of the Extension.
</p>

<p>
    Google API Services: The Extension uses Google API services to access your Google Tasks data. Your use of these
    services is subject to Google's privacy policies.
</p>

<h3>Data Security</h3>

<p>
    Local Storage: OAuth tokens and any other data accessed by the Extension are stored locally on your device. We do
    not transmit this data to our servers.
</p>

<p>
    No Additional Security Measures: Our Extension relies on standard security measures provided by the browser and
    Google API services. We do not implement additional technical or organizational security measures beyond these
    standard practices.
</p>

<h3>User Choices and Controls</h3>

<p>
    Revoke Access: You can revoke the Extension's access to your Google Tasks data at any time through your Google
    account settings.
</p>

<p>
    Uninstallation: If you uninstall the Extension, all locally stored data, including OAuth tokens, will be deleted
    from your device.
</p>

<h3>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h3>

<p>
    We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy
    Policy on our website or through the Extension. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any
    changes.
